Reminders
=========

What is this? 

  - First BB10 application created by me
  - Essentially a Reminders application designed to help you keep track of your daily tasks
  - Ability to sort into complete and incomplete

Is this application going to be updated?

  Short answer is no. The long version is that since this application was launched, I have seen BB10's market share decline
  as well as see the overall company's status be quite poor which has really made me sceptical of its future. I do not see the
  vision in this platform considering the effort that would be involved. I would like to focus on Android and other major platforms
  at this point. 
  
Can I clone this and take it from there?

  Absolutely! Please do so!
